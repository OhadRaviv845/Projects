Strategies for the clever player and for the snartypamts player - snartypamts is defined to look through the board
for the best streak it can extend or block. The clever player is designed to iterate thorugh the board starting at the
top left corner, moving right through the columns and going down a line when reaching the end. It will put it's mark in
the first free spot it will find. We can see in the results below, that cleverplayer is better then the random
version of mr. whatever, but mr. snartypamts is by far better than clever player.
