====================================================================


==================
=  Description:  =
==================

first part is working with iterators and generators, working to compute different mathematics and to iterate through
lists.
second part is working with second order programing, defining functions that create new functions to create mathemtical
computations and the last one is used for binary search to compute the zero of a function within a certain interval.

=  Special Comments  =

1. further documentation is on each function.
