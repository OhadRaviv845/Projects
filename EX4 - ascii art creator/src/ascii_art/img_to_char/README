=          Design           =
=============================
The program uses different calculations and normalizations in order to take a given picture and turn it into ascii art.
chooseChars() is the method which is called upon first, I chose to design it using the setupChars to create the array
and then call upon convrtImageToAscii() which does calculations in itself and also calls for further methods.

=============================
=  Implementation details   =
=============================
As required, the implementation took place only on the file BrightnessImageCharMatcher.java
Further documentation is inside the code.
