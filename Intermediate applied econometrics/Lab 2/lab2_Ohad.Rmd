## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
rm(list = ls())
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyr)
library(stargazer, quietly=TRUE)
library(ggplot2, quietly = TRUE)
library(Rcpp)
library(ri2, quietly = TRUE)
library(Hmisc)
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
```
```{r}
setwd("/Users/ohad/Documents/לימודים/applied econometrics/lab 2")
df <- read.table("PROGRESA.csv", header=TRUE, sep=",")
names(df)
colnames(df)
```
#QUESTION 1:
```{r}
df$Pre <- ifelse(df$wave==2, 1, 0)
df$treat <- df$progresa1    #changing the col name from progresa to treat
df$fem <- df$sex1
dfPre <- df[df$Pre==1,]
DataC <- with(dfPre,tapply(school,list(treat, age1),mean)) #using the relevant data - "Age"\"Control" and age
dimnames(DataC)[[1]] <-c("Control","Treated") #changing names for the columns
Treated <- (DataC[2,])
Control <- (DataC[1,])

# make a long matrix, boys all age bins, then girls all age bins, to setup for ggplot
Age <- as.factor(c(6:19, 6:19)) # want ages 9 through 19 to capture kids we had since baseline
EffSch <- matrix(c(Treated[1:14], Control[1:14]), nrow = 28, ncol = 1)
treat <- c(rep("Treated", 14), rep("Control", 14))
tabEff <- data.frame(Age, treat, EffSch)

plotEff <- ggplot(tabEff, aes(x = Age, y = EffSch, fill = treat)) +
  geom_col(width = 0.7, position = position_dodge(width=0.8)) +
  theme_bw(base_size = 10) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom", legend.title = element_blank()) +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(from = -0.1, to = 0.1, by = 0.05)) +
  xlab("Age") +
  ylab("Mean School Enrollment") +
  ggtitle("Mean school enrollment by age in the pre period")

print(plotEff)
```
#QUESTION 2:


```{r}
df_ <- subset(dfPre, dfPre$school==1)
```

```{r}
histo_data <- subset(dfPre,dfPre$school == 1)
histo_data <- histo_data[c("hgc1", "school")]

#creating a smaller dataframe that only has the desired data
ggplot(histo_data, aes(hgc1)) +
  geom_histogram(fill = "deepskyblue3") + ggtitle("Number of students completed each grade level in the pre-period") +scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(0:9))+
  xlab("Grade")
```

## Including Plots

#QUESTION 3:
```{r}
gradebysex <- select(subset(dfPre,dfPre$school == 1),c("hgc1","sex1")) #creating a df that counts how many have finished each grade by sex
#gradebysex <- gradebysex[c("hgc1", "sex1")]
gradebysex$sex1 <- ifelse(gradebysex$sex1==0, "boy", "girl") #replacing values 0,1 with "boy","girl"
gradebysex <- select(gradebysex, c("hgc1", "sex1"))

ggplot(gradebysex, aes(hgc1, fill = factor(sex1))) + 
   geom_histogram(alpha = 0.9, aes(y = ..count..), position = 'dodge') +
   xlim(0,9) +xlab("Grade") + guides(fill=guide_legend(title="Sex"))+
  labs(title = expression("Number of students who completed each grade"),
       subtitle = expression("Divided by sex"))+scale_x_continuous(breaks=c(0:9))
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

#QUESTION 4:
Randomization inference is where we create a randomized hypotheses test environment, this way we can check all the events that could've happened and not just what has already happened in a certain time line.

#QUESTION 5:
We have created a dataframe by taking a survey in a few waves, first before all treatment, then post treatment. We divide the villages into two different groups - the tretment group and the control group. We then calculate means of school enrolment - comparing between the two different groups we have created, subtracting the mean school enrolment. this is our analysis for the treatment efficiency, to make our thesis more certain we also use randomization inference - we randomize data and compare treatment in different ways to confirm our null thesis.
