## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
setwd("/Users/ohad/Documents/לימודים/applied econometrics/PS1")

```{r}
#part 3

#set a seed
set.seed(100)

permutations <- genperms(noNA_df$treat)

probs <- genprobexact(noNA_df$treat, clustvar = noNA_df$SUBJECT)

unique(probs)
dim(permutations)
```
```{r}
#2
EstFunc <- function(noNA_df, perms, prob, vars) {
  #creating average treatment effects through the function
  Ates <- function(vec) {
    PotentialOutcome <- genouts(vec, noNA_df$treat)
    ATES <- gendist(PotentialOutcome, perms, pr=unique(prob))
    return(ATES)
  }
  #now apple to all the vars using sapply
  ans <- sapply(noNA_df[c(vars)], Ates)
  return(ans)
}

PvalueTable <- function(noNA_df, perm, probs, means_table, vars) {
  

  #creating a matrix of estimates
  estimate <- abs(EstFunc(noNA_df,perm,probs,vars))
  
  #computing the mean difference between treat and control
  actual_diff <- abs(t(means_table["effect"]))
  
  #next we'll check how many values are higher than than the result we got for the real difference
  raw_data <- c()
  for (col in colnames(actual_diff)) {
    counter <- sum(estimate[,c(col)] >= actual_diff[,c(col)])/10000
    raw_data <- c(raw_data, counter)
  }
  p_value_data <- data.frame(parameter = colnames(actual_diff), p_val =raw_data)
  #set the p_value in order
  p_value_data <- p_value_data[order(p_value_data$p_val),]
  #total p_value received
  p_value_data <- rbind(p_value_data, c("Total", round(mean(p_value_data$p_val), 4)))
  #computing by precentage
  p_value_data$p_val <- percent(as.numeric(p_value_data$p_val))
  return(p_value_data)
}

P_val_Total <- PvalueTable(noNA_df, permutations, probs, means_table, vars)
stargazer(t(P_val_Total),type="text",flip=T,title="P-Values for all 14 variables")
```
We got that in total 37% of the treatment effects in the distribution that we created were at least as significant.

Therfore we cannot reject the null hypothesis with a good confidence.

However if we look at the parameters we di see that IQ and college params are less than 5-10% so we can infer that the treatment did make a change. Thanks to the treatment children will go more to school and have a better IQ. 
```{r}
```{r, echo=FALSE}
stargazer(means_table,type="text",title="Estimated average treatment effects", digits=2,summary = FALSE, covariate.labels = c("Var","Mean treated", "Mean not treated", "Avrage treatment effect"), out.header=TRUE)
```

About the params that got 100% we know that in our table with the difference in means from section 2, we saw these params (convicted, felon, jailed, marijuana etc), had a minimal difference between the treated and not treated.

So we can infer that the treatment is indeed effective but not in all the params tested.

```{r}
#Same as above only automated
PermProbs <- function(table) {
  permutations <- genperms(table$treat)
  probs <- genprobexact(table$treat, clustvar = table$SUBJECT)
  return(list(permutations, probs))
}

dfMale <- subset(noNA_df, noNA_df$fem==0)
dfFemale <- subset(noNA_df, noNA_df$fem==1)

M_perms_probs <- PermProbs(dfMale)
F_perms_probs <- PermProbs(dfFemale)

P_val_Males <- PvalueTable(dfMale, M_perms_probs[[1]], M_perms_probs[[2]], Male_means_table, vars)
P_val_Females <- PvalueTable(dfFemale, F_perms_probs[[1]], F_perms_probs[[2]], Female_means_table, vars)

stargazer(t(P_val_Males),type="text",flip=T,title="P-Values for all 14 variables-Only Males")

stargazer(t(P_val_Females),type="text",flip=T,title="P-Values for all 14 variables-Only Females")
```

We'll now compare the differences between boys and girls:

We can see that the IQ at younger ages improved more for boys than for girls. on the other hand, the IQ at older ages improved more for girls than for boys.

we can see that the employment is impacted more for boys than for the girls.

it seems the treatment works better for boys in the parameters of "crime" than for girls (which could be because girls were initially less involved in crime).

To concolude there is a slight difference between the sexes in effects of the treatment.


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
