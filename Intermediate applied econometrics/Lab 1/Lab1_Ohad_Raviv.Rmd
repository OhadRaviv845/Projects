## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(haven)
library(Hmisc)
library(ggplot2)
waitingtime <- data.frame(
  time = as.Date('2012-01-01') + 0:9,
  firstPerson = abs(rnorm(10, 0, 1)),
  secondPerson = abs(rnorm(10, 2, 6)),
  thirdPerson = abs(rnorm(10, 4, 2))
)

waitingtime
waitingtime_l <- waitingtime %>% gather(person, waiting, -time)
waitingtime_l
waitingtime_w <- waitingtime_l %>% spread(person, waiting)
waitingtime_w
```
```{r}
footballPlayers <- data.frame(
    surname = c("Ronaldo", "Messi", "Mbape", "Beckham", "Zidane", "Van-nistleroy"),
    nationality = c("Portugal", "Argentina", "France", "UK", "France", "Netherlands"),
    retired = c("yes", rep("no", 5)))
teams <- data.frame(
    name = c("Ronaldo", "Messi", "Mbape", "Beckham", "Zidane", "Inzaghi"),
    team = c("Real Madrid",
              "FC Barca",
              "PSG",
              "Man United",
              "Real Madrid",
               "AC Milan"),
    MVP = c(NA, "Yes", NA, NA, NA, NA))
teams_and_footballPlayers <- merge(teams, footballPlayers, by.x="name", by.y="surname") #inner join
teams_and_footballPlayers <- merge(teams, footballPlayers, by.x="name", by.y="surname", all.x=TRUE) #left join
teams_and_footballPlayers
```
```{r}
setwd("/Users/ohad/Documents/לימודים/applied econometrics/lab1")
chetty <- read_dta("mrc_table1.dta")
chettyCA <- subset(chetty, state=="CA")
chettyMA <- subset(chetty, state=="MA")
chettyAL <- subset(chetty, state=="AL")
vectorofmeans <- c(mean(chettyCA$par_median), mean(chettyMA$par_median), mean(chettyAL$par_median))
vectorofmeans
barplot(vectorofmeans, main = "Average of parent income, CA, MA and AL", xlab="state", names.arg=c("California", "Massachusets", "Alabama"), col=c("blue", "orange", "red"))
```
```{r}
chetty <- as_tibble(chetty)
chetty <- chetty %>%
  add_count(state, sort=TRUE, name="count_by_state")
chetty[,c("czname", "name", "count_by_state")]
```
## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
